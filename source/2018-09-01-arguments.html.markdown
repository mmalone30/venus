## Arguments

### September 1, 2018

There are at least two types of arguments—functional and assertive.

In a functional arguments, participants have a common goal but different perspectives and they argue to gain alignment on those perspectives. Functional arguments happen when people try to figure out the best way of accomplishing something. The thing to accomplish is agreed upon but not the how, when, or why. Functional arguments are constructive and, under the right circumstances, fun.

Engineers and designers usually have lots of functional arguments around what to build, how to solve a given problem. It leads to tremendous collaboration but it’s all predicated on the assumption that the goal of the project is agreed upon.

Assertive arguments are not usually fun. In an assertive argument, participants have different goals and perspectives and the purpose of the argument is simply to assert one's position. Assertive arguments seldom end well because no one is able to make progress in what they are accomplishing because they are talking about different things. Sometimes it is important to plant your feet and assert your position in the face of fierce&mdash;and especially unjust&mdash;opposition, even if you know that that's all you might do.

Teams need to have functional arguments and stay away from assertive ones as best they can.
