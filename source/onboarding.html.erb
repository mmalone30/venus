  <h2>Weedmaps Onboarding</h2>
  <h3>
    In January 2018, California&mdash;Weedmaps' largest market&mdash;was set to legalize recreational cannabis. The potential for the business was undeniable so we wanted to make it easier than ever to enter the cannabis community.

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      Recreational legalization in California has the potential to unlock a huge new market for Weedmaps and send the company into a tremendous growth trajectory. Activating those users is critical to the business. But Weedmaps' value proposition isn't immediately clear when you get into the app. We needed to clear up why you'd create an account and enable key device features to get the most out of the product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, we had two main questions: how do we easily communicate the value of device features (location and notifications) and how to make it dead-simple to create an account?

    This sketch demonstrates the poor first-time user experience with Weedmaps on iOS and Android. Device prompts for location, notifications, and sign up come out of nowhere and offer little reason for such requests.

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      The design team worked with product managers, marketing, and our technical writers to develop the copy for the onboarding. Our assumption was that the words we used to describe the product and request the device features was the most important component.
